# Bittex Subnet

</div>

## Overview

The idea behind Bittex subnet is to build a DEX providing the most competitive rate in the world, which is powered by Bittensor.

Miners are liquidity providers to the platform. They compete with each other for a better exchange rate to get more incentives.

At its core lies the smart contract which ensures the correct execution of each swap.

A swap is "atomic" in the Bittex, which means that liquidity providers deposit their funds for each individual swap transaction instead of to a pool. The "atomic swap" approach reduces the risk of impermanent loss and providing more efficient liquidity provision.

Bittex Subnet aims to be the go-to platform for users looking for the best exchange rates, making Bittensor more popular among a wider audience. As Bittensor gains more popularity, it will lead to the development of new subnets, speeding up advancements in AI.
