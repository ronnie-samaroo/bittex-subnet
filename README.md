# Bittex Subnet

</div>

## Overview

The idea behind Bittex subnet is to build a DEX providing the most competitive rate in the world, which is powered by Bittensor.

Miners are liquidity providers to the platform. They compete with each other for a better exchange rate to get more incentives.

At its core lies the smart contract which ensures the correct execution of each swap.

A swap is "atomic" in the Bittex, which means that liquidity providers deposit their funds for each individual swap transaction instead of to a pool. The "atomic swap" approach reduces the risk of impermanent loss and providing more efficient liquidity provision.

Bittex Subnet aims to be the go-to platform for users looking for the best exchange rates, making Bittensor more popular among a wider audience. As Bittensor gains more popularity, it will lead to the development of new subnets, speeding up advancements in AI.

## Architecture

![Bittex Subnet Sequence Diagram](docs/Bittex%20Subnet%20Sequence%20Diagram.png)

**IMPORTANT**: If you are new to Bittensor subnets, read this section before proceeding to [Installation](#installation) section. 

The Bittensor blockchain hosts multiple self-contained incentive mechanisms called **subnets**. Subnets are playing fields in which:
- Subnet miners who produce value, and
- Subnet validators who produce consensus

determine together the proper distribution of TAO for the purpose of incentivizing the creation of value, i.e., generating digital commodities, such as intelligence or data. 

Each subnet consists of:
- Subnet miners and subnet validators.
- A protocol using which the subnet miners and subnet validators interact with one another. This protocol is part of the incentive mechanism.
- The Bittensor API using which the subnet miners and subnet validators interact with Bittensor's onchain consensus engine [Yuma Consensus](https://bittensor.com/documentation/validating/yuma-consensus). The Yuma Consensus is designed to drive these actors: subnet validators and subnet miners, into agreement on who is creating value and what that value is worth. 

This starter template is split into three primary files. To write your own incentive mechanism, you should edit these files. These files are:
1. `template/protocol.py`: Contains the definition of the protocol used by subnet miners and subnet validators.
2. `neurons/miner.py`: Script that defines the subnet miner's behavior, i.e., how the subnet miner responds to requests from subnet validators.
3. `neurons/validator.py`: This script defines the subnet validator's behavior, i.e., how the subnet validator requests information from the subnet miners and determines the scores.

## Installation

### Before you proceed
Before you proceed with the installation of the subnet, note the following: 

- Use these instructions to run your subnet locally for your development and testing, or on Bittensor testnet or on Bittensor mainnet. 
- **IMPORTANT**: We **strongly recommend** that you first run your subnet locally and complete your development and testing before running the subnet on Bittensor testnet. Furthermore, make sure that you next run your subnet on Bittensor testnet before running it on the Bittensor mainnet.
- You can run your subnet either as a subnet owner, or as a subnet validator or as a subnet miner. 
- **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you are aware of the minimum compute requirements for your subnet. See the [Minimum compute YAML configuration](./min_compute.yml).
- Note that installation instructions differ based on your situation: For example, installing for local development and testing will require a few additional steps compared to installing for testnet. Similarly, installation instructions differ for a subnet owner vs a validator or a miner. 

### Install

- **Running locally**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running Subnet Locally](./docs/running_on_staging.md).
<!-- - **Running on Bittensor testnet**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running on the Test Network](./docs/running_on_testnet.md).
- **Running on Bittensor mainnet**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running on the Main Network](./docs/running_on_mainnet.md). -->

## Writing your own incentive mechanism

When you are ready to write your own incentive mechanism, update this template repository by editing the following files. The code in these files contains detailed documentation on how to update the template. Read the documentation in each of the files to understand how to update the template. There are multiple **TODO**s in each of the files identifying sections you should update. These files are:
- `template/protocol.py`: Contains the definition of the wire-protocol used by miners and validators.
- `neurons/miner.py`: Script that defines the miner's behavior, i.e., how the miner responds to requests from validators.
- `neurons/validator.py`: This script defines the validator's behavior, i.e., how the validator requests information from the miners and determines the scores.
- `template/forward.py`: Contains the definition of the validator's forward pass.
- `template/reward.py`: Contains the definition of how validators reward miner responses.

In addition to the above files, you should also update the following files:
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for your project. Update this file to reflect your project's documentation.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: This file contains the instructions for contributing to your project. Update this file to reflect your project's contribution guidelines.
- `template/__init__.py`: This file contains the version of your project.
- `setup.py`: This file contains the metadata about your project. Update this file to reflect your project's metadata.
- `docs/`: This directory contains the documentation for your project. Update this directory to reflect your project's documentation.
